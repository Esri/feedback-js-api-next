# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript - next

![Current build version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@arcgis/core/next?label=Current%20build)

**https://js.arcgis.com/5.0.0-next/map-components/** and **https://js.arcgis.com/5.0.0-next/**

Welcome to the next version of the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript (version 5). There are several important changes at version 5. The SDK is [moving to semantic versioning](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/js-api-arcgis/announcements/arcgis-maps-sdk-for-javascript-is-moving-to-semantic-versioning), and the next CDN URLs now use the full version (e.g. `5.0.0-next`) in place of `next`.

This version of the SDK is currently in development and will be updated frequently until the production release in February 2026. Try out new features, perform regression testing, and get a feel for the next release - then share your feedback with the development team. Please make sure that bug reports and enhancement requests are specific to `next` or `rc` (release candidate) versions, and not applicable to a released version. It is best to ask questions about released versions on the [Esri Community](https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-javascript-maps-sdk-questions/bd-p/arcgis-api-for-javascript-questions) site.

Please note: ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript release management is dynamic. Some new features and updates that appear in next builds might not be present in the final production release due to a variety of factors (but will likely be present in an upcoming release).

See the FAQ on [Versioning and change management](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/faq/#versioning-and-change-management) for more information.
