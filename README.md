Welcome to the next version of the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript (4.34). This version of the SDK is currently in development and will be updated frequently until the production release in October 2025. Try out new features, perform regression testing, and get a feel for the next release - then share your feedback with the development team. Please make sure that bug reports and enhancement requests are specific to `next` or `rc` (release candidate) versions, and not applicable to a released version.

Please note: ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript release management is dynamic. Some new features and updates that appear in next builds might not be present in the final production release due to a variety of factors (but will likely be present in an upcoming release).
