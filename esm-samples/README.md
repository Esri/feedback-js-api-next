# @arcgis/core

The [`@arcgis/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) is currently in development and will be released in `beta` at 4.18. It is not currently supported as there are still some issues to work out, and should not be used in production applications yet.

The projects in this directory are samples on how to integrate `@arcgis/core` with various build tools and framework tooling.

The key to integrating `@arcgis/core` is to copy the `@arcgis/core/assets` folder to your build directory for your application. This folder contains assets such as styles, fonts, images, translation files and the built workers used by the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

You can refer to the [ES Modules readme](../ES_modules.md) for more information.
